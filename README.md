# Strapi Project

## Introduction
This is a Strapi-based project for building a headless CMS. Strapi provides an API-first approach, making it easy to manage and distribute content across multiple platforms.

## Features
- API-first CMS
- Customizable admin panel
- Role-based access control
- Supports REST and GraphQL
- Media library

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (>=14.x)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, or MongoDB (if using a database other than the default SQLite)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/strapi-project.git
   cd strapi-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

3. Start the Strapi server:
   ```sh
   npm run develop  # or yarn develop
   ```
   The server will start at `http://localhost:1337`

## Configuration
Strapi configurations can be found in the `config` directory. You can modify database settings, authentication, and other environment variables.

## Running in Production
To run Strapi in production mode:
```sh
npm run build
npm run start
```

## API Endpoints
After setting up content types, Strapi auto-generates API endpoints. You can access them at:
```
http://localhost:1337/api/{content-type}
```

For GraphQL:
```
http://localhost:1337/graphql
```

## Deployment
